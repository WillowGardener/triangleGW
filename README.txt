this is a website all about triangles. If you tell it the length of each side of
your triangle, it will tell you whether a triangle
is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and it will do so in an ominous
and sometimes mean-spirited fashion, particularly if you enter side lengths
that do not combine to create a legitimate triangle. This is because robots are
mean.
